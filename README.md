# Solving Problems by Searching.ipynb

This project for an artificial intelligence course at the university.

In this project, we write interactive AI tutorial Solving Problems by Searching. The Jupyter notebook has explained the algorithms and related concepts in both Arabic and English, and most importantly it has explained how to implement the algorithms from scratch. The notebook also contains problem from our daily interactions, to which the algorithms are applied, and, where applicable, their performance evaluated and compared. The reader can test and change variables in the problem/algorithm so they can understand the important concepts.

Important note: Because there are two languages for the explanation in one file, HTML codes were used to make the explanation readable in the best way, to see the project better, please download the file and open it using Jupyter-Anaconda.
